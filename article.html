        <p>Imagine having the ability to read an old language that no one else understands. Skimming through pages of old barks, fully covered by a foreign inscription that only you could comprehend. Each piece of ancient script that you translate then becomes an entrance into your predecessor’s lives–a peek to their thoughts, beliefs and daily struggles–and might as well become a new guide in navigating the present.</p>

        <p>Those are the world of a philologist, a rare yet fascinating profession where linguistics, history, and culture intertwined. In Indonesia, a country celebrated for its cultural and linguistic diversity, a philologist becomes the bridge between the past gone by and the future ahead. They unravel ancient texts, safeguard endangered languages, and ensure that past knowledge safely passes through the leap of time to enrich modern civilization.</p>

        <h2>Makassar, The Far East</h2>
    </header>

        <p>The far East of Indonesia, South Sulawesi is renowned for being one of the richest repositories of ancient manuscripts. As the home of the longest ancient scroll ever found, the infamous La Galigo, the region still remains a treasure trove yet to be fully explored by the global linguistic community.</p>

    <p>In the bustling capital of South Sulawesi, Makassar, <b>Prof. Dr. Muhlis Hadrawi</b> sits in his office, surrounded by stacks of yellowed manuscripts, each waiting to be decoded. As a philologist and a lecturer at Universitas Hasanuddin, he expertises in deciphering and unraveling ancient Bugis scripts, bringing the region’s rich heritage to life. When asked about his motivation, Muhlis shared that it stems from his unwavering dedication to preserve the essence of his native Bugis roots.  “It is indeed based on the fact that I am a Buginese by birth and have been staying in Makassar,” Muhlis proudly emphasized his personal connection to the Bugis culture.</p>

</figure>

    <p>His enthusiasm for Bugis scripts is not solely rooted in his ethnic background but also in the fact that South Sulawesi’s abundant ancient manuscripts create a vast field, ripe for new discoveries and research. “Apart from the rich written tradition of the Bugis language, which is the Lontara script, the abundance of ancient manuscripts in the region provides a fertile ground for research. This makes opportunities for philological studies widely open and sweetly promising,” he exclaimed with excitement. Muhlis also added that this very reason becomes one of the driving forces behind the government's decision to establish the world’s only Bugis Language Major at Universitas Hasanuddin.</p>

    <p>Being a philologist since 1988, Muhlis recalls numerous moments of discovery and breakthrough that shaped his journey. When asked about his most memorable discovery, the philologist traces back to 2008, when he found a manuscript called Assikalaibineng. Unlike other manuscripts that typically explore past empires and royal lineages, Assikalaibineng is a scroll focused on intimate household relations. It offers a deeper view of the marital dynamics of the Bugis people. “It [Assikalaibineng] provides a traditional concept of the relationship between husband and wife as something sacred and a blessing from Allah. Therefore, familial dynamics must be carried out with honor, ethics, and mutual respect,” said Muhlis. He added that his published translation of Assikalaibineng became a bestseller, often given as a wedding gift to soon-to-be couples for their premarital household education.</p>

    <p>Muhlis' discovery of the Assikalaibineng manuscript highlights the relevance of ancient knowledge in the present day. The concept of the familial bond is a universal and timeless concept, transcending generations and cultures. By revisiting these traditional values, modern society is reminded of the importance of respect, love, and mutual understanding in building strong familial foundations. Much like Assikalaibineng, numerous manuscripts are not merely a cultural artifact but also as a guide for contemporary relations, bridging the past and the future.</p>

        <h2>Banda Aceh, the Wondrous West</h2>
    </header>

    <p>South Sulawesi is among several regions of Indonesia famous for its linguistic heritage. Traveling across the opposite direction, towards the wondrous west, we arrive in Banda Aceh, where the region’s rich history and linguistic traditions offers a rather different yet equally fascinating cultural perspective.</p>

    <p>In the historic city of Banda Aceh, <b>Hermansyah</b> dedicates his days to teaching at Universitas Islam Negeri Ar-Raniry, where he primarily focuses on manuscripts and the native language, Jawi and Melayu. Unlike Muhlis, whose work revolves around hands-on preservation, Hermansyah’s role as a philologist emphasizes education and public socialization. He strives to raise awareness about the importance of Acehnese manuscripts while bridging the gap between academic and community to ensure the region’s linguistic heritage remains fully appreciated.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

    <p>Hermansyah’s tendency towards public engagement is not without reason, as Aceh is one of the key centers for ancient manuscript development in the Nusantara. According to Hermansyah, many old scrolls found across Indonesia and beyond, particularly those focused on Islam, were influenced by Acehnese intellectual and religious education. “Some of the most impactful Muslim figures in Java, Banten, and Padang acquired their knowledge in Aceh. For example, in Makassar, there was Yusuf Al-Makassari, a scholar who studied in Aceh and later passed away in South Africa. Also the infamous nine Muslim preachers, Wali Songo, who came to Java after studying in Aceh." Hermansyah explained in the interview.</p>

    <p>Aceh was said to have the highest number of Muslim written works scattered across regions in Indonesia. Many even reached Southeast Asia, such as the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, and Brunei. Till this day, many of the scripts were heirlooms to members of the community.</p>

    <p>While the Acehnese people are often aware of the monetary value of these manuscripts, they sometimes fail to grasp its social significance. As a result, prized manuscripts are occasionally mishandled and sold at a high price point to foreign buyers. This is where Hermansyah steps in, educating manuscript owners about the importance of preserving these heirlooms within the nation. He encourages them to sell their manuscripts ethically to the government, rather than to outside third parties to safeguard Indonesia’s historical legacy.</p>

    <p>After nearly a decade of tireless efforts to educate the public and collaborate with authorities on ethical manuscript acquisitions, Hermansyah’s hard work saw the light. “We’ve made extraordinary progress. The public has started to care about the significance of their manuscripts. I can even say that we [my team and the government] have saved and purchased nearly a thousand manuscripts over the past 10 years,” he proudly shared. Among the treasures saved is a complete seven chapter version of Bustanus Al-Salatin, a manuscript about the Aceh Kingdom, written by Nuruddin Ar-Raniry in 1636.</p>

    <p>Hermansyah’s unwavering dedication in preserving Aceh’s ancient literary heritage underscores the importance of safeguarding cultural artifacts as a collective responsibility. By bridging the gap between local community members and government authorities, he has not only rescued countless priceless manuscripts but also fostered a deeper appreciation for their historical and cultural significance.</p>

        <h2>Manassa : Separated by Space, United by Thoughts</h2>
    </header>

    <p>Muhlis and Hermansyah, two separate individuals, kept apart by Indonesia’s vast archipelago are united by the same goal of preserving the nation’s culture and history through their distinctive approach to philology. Beyond their goal, the two philologists also share a bond in Masyarakat Pernaskahan Nusantara (Manassa), an organization dedicated for manuscript researchers for both professionals and semi-professionals.</p>

    <p>Manassa serves as the only organization for philologists in Indonesia. With nearly 800 members from across the globe, Manassa has become a platform for philologists to voice their aspirations and collaborate on efforts to preserve the nation’s manuscript heritage. Through Manassa, they exchange thoughts and resources, especially concerns towards Indonesia's linguistic preservation field.</p>

    <p><b>Munawar Holil, or Kang Mumu</b>, the Chairperson of Manassa, plays a pivotal role in connecting philologists across the archipelago with the government. As one of the founding members of the organization in 1996, he has tirelessly fostering collaboration and advocacy for manuscript preservation. Throughout the years, he has been listing issues among active philologists, hoping to eradicate and improve the preservation ecosystem.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="kang mumu.png" style="width:100%;">
     <figcaption style="font-size:0.7em; text-align:center;">Munawar Holil in an interview at Universitas Indonesia, Depok, West Java (03/12/2024). (Personal Archive)</figcaption>
</figure>

    <p>According to Kang Mumu, from the beginning, the most concerning issue has been the lack of proper legal regulations specifically made to safeguard manuscripts and ancient scrolls. Until this moment, there are only two legal instruments designed to protect ancient linguistic scrolls, which are the Law of the Republic of Indonesia Number 43 of 2007 and the recent Number 5 of 2017. “Although the regulations are present, the implementations are still far, very distant from enough.” he added. Kang Mumu emphasized the urgent need for stricter enforcement of these regulations to prevent further loss of valuable manuscripts.</p>

    <p>The absence of a proper regulation becomes a lethal mistake that leads to more issues. Due to the lenient law, manuscript preservation was often overshadowed and less prioritized, including in government financial allocations. This lack of funding translates into inadequate facilities. Kang Mumu highlights improper storage facilities as another significant challenge. Local museums and libraries were supposed to be properly equipped with temperature and humidity conditioners in order to prevent manuscripts from getting damaged, but according to his observation, none of the places are fully facilitated. “So, yes, I am sad. But then what? They [local museums and libraries] lack budget, especially since decentralization where the budgeting lays on the hands of local authorities. If the local authorities do care, they might allocate a fortune, but if they don't, then it will be very difficult,” Kang Mumu expressed his sadness.</p>

    <p>The National Library is no exception to the chairman’s critics. Home of more than 12.000 manuscripts and the largest library nationwide, Kang Mumu also finds it lacking necessary resources to properly preserve and protect these invaluable historical documents. This inadequate facilities puts manuscripts at risk of deterioration and loss. When asked about the issue, the National Library Preservation Unit acknowledged their shortcomings. “As the National Library, we admit that we are far below standard. Why? Because during the construction of the building, the investment costs were likely too high if we followed the supposed standard, and at the time, the project lacked proper guidance to ensure detailed planning,” they explained (17/12/2024). They then, again, emphasized that the limited budget became their main problem.</p>

    <p>Minimal budget allocations also posed an obstacle for obtaining crucial pieces of scrolls which were owned by the members of the society. Hermansyah previously mentioned the difficulty of convincing the government to purchase valuable scrolls. The unpurchased manuscripts were then at risk of being acquired by foreign owners, willing to spend a fortune on ancient relics. Kang Mumu seems to relate to the same problem. “In numerous regions, the manuscript owners were often in a bad economic condition, living in a financial strain, which drove them to sell their manuscripts to foreign buyers at high prices. This happened frequently, especially between 2020 and 2022,” he retold his experience in a serious tone.</p>

    <p>Other than that, both Kang Mumu and Muhlis expressed their disappointment at the lack of support for philologists as a profession.  They especially accentuate the insufficient research and excavation support, which are crucial for uncovering and preserving ancient manuscripts. “Funding for ancient manuscript research in Indonesia often comes from international organizations. For example Ford Foundation, Toyota, and even from Germany. Unlike international foundations, Indonesia itself has yet to provide significant support,” Kang Mumu stated. Additionally, scholarships for aspiring philologists are also minimal, making it harder to nurture the next generation of experts in this field. It is ironic to see how Indonesia, the very owner of these priceless manuscripts, remains neglectful of its own research and preservation efforts.</p>

        <h2>The Future Hope for the Prized Past</h2>
    </header>

    <p>From inadequate funding and facilities to the lack of support for philologists, the struggles in Indonesia’s philology field highlight a broader issue of neglect toward cultural preservation. Yet, amidst these challenges, blossoms of future hope arise.</p>

    <p>Along with the advancement of technology, the digitization of manuscripts emerged as a new method of preservation. By converting fragile physical texts into digital formats, philologists and preservationists can ensure wider accessibility while protecting the originals from deterioration. Digitization has also played a key role in repatriating Indonesian manuscripts overseas allowing these cultural treasures to return home in digital form, reconnecting the nation with its long lost heritage.</p>

<figure>

     <figcaption style="font-size:0.7em; text-align:center;">A manuscript scanner at the National Library Preservation Center, Salemba, Central Jakarta (17/12/2024). (Personal Archive)</figcaption>
</figure>

    <p>The National Library has been actively working to digitize the manuscripts in its collection. According to the National Library’s Preservation Unit, by 2023, they had successfully digitized 5,000 manuscripts, nearly half of their possession. “We have been digitizing 50% of our manuscript collection and aim to digitize our whole collection by next year.” they boldly stated (17/12/2024). The Preservation Unit marked a bright progress in preserving Indonesia’s literary heritage for future generations.</p>

    <p>Besides technology, the resurgence of the new youth generation acts as a fresh breath of hope, especially to the three philologists. Muhlis, Hermansyah, and Kang Mumu have been living witnesses to the ups and downs in the philology field. Despite the challenges, they optimistically envision a future of a culturally aware young generation equipped with advanced technology, actively participating in manuscript perseverance around the nation, from the far east to the wondrous west.</p>

    <p>“It is time for the new generation to rise and create their own new system–or what I would call ecosystem–to raise interest and awareness regarding manuscripts amongst the people before they fully dive into the field,” said Hermansyah.  “I believe the younger generation has an important role in collaborating with IT professionals to bridge two eras: the era of the ancient manuscripts and the modern era,” he added with full of hope.</p>

    <p>Kang Mumu also said, “If we want our future to be far greater than the past, do not forget to take a look back at the past lessons. For as the saying goes, future greatness is unattainable without recalling the wisdom we have gained.”</p>
